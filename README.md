# funny-calculator
Just a challenge

## Specifics
- Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
- The method must accept a string of 0, 1 or 2 numbers for example “” or “1” or “1,2” and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0)
- Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
- Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
- The following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
- The following input is NOT ok: “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)
- Support different delimiters
- To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
- The first line is optional. All existing scenarios should still be supported
- Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed. If there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message
-Bonus point for unit tests
